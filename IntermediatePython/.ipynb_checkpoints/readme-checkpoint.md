# Intermediate Python

This folder has some workbooks that are meant to help you level up in areas that I think are important for data science.  We will be using some of these concepts later in class, so it is a good idea to review them if you aren't already pretty comfortable.

To be honest, there is a ton of stuff in here I didn't know until I started putting them together.  So even if you are an ok coder like me, it might be worth a skim.

Here is what is covered:

## Data Structures

* List comprehensions
* Randomness
* Tuples
* Sets
* Dictionaries
* Zip, map, filter and enumerations
* Functions as values
* Lambda functions
* Sorting

## Pandas

This covers the syntax for typical data manipulation, but also introduces handy ways to explore data sets.  For a quick reference I really like Vicki Boykis's [Cheat Sheet of Useful Pandas Idioms](https://github.com/veekaybee/til/blob/master/python/pandas_cheat_sheet.md).

## Numpy

This one is really short, and is actually about array indexing.  It pays special attention to logical indexing and multi-dimensional arrays.
